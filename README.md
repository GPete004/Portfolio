Welcome to my engineering portfolio. I’m a 4th year Mechanical Engineering student with a strong interest in simulation, control systems, thermal-fluid sciences, and applied software tools in engineering. This repository showcases a selection of my university and personal projects.

Each project  demonstrates different aspects of my technical development—from data modeling and simulation to design reports, CAD, and control applications.
